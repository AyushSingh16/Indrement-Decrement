# Increment And Decrement

Hello there! This is a practice project in which I had implemented some of the Modern Javascript's concepts for getting better understanding of Javascript along with TailwindCSS and HTML.

# Summary

In this project, if you press the " + " button, the integral value would get incremented by 1. Similarly, if you press the " - " button, the integral value would get decremented by 1.

These types of components are often seen in modern E-Commerce platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra for the customers to select the quantity of products which the customer wants to purchase.
